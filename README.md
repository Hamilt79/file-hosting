# file-hosting

Just a small webserver using Go.\
I get annoyed trying to copy large files between computers without a USB since half of all self-written programs get flagged by Google Drive and other online storage platforms as malware, so I made this.\
Lets you easily send files to a VPS you bought or a self-hosted machine and gives you a link that anyone can use to download whatever you uploaded.\
I know nothing of security so if you ever try to upload anything sensitive to something running this, don't.\
